        <ul>
            <li>Financial Planning is a very necessary and critical part of everybodies life, and the ability to make peoples lives easier and better excites me.</li>
            <li>My goal is to use my knowledge and love for solving problems to help people acheive their financial goals</li>
            <li>Financial Planners generally have a flexible schedule,as opposed to Accountants who struggle maintaining family-life balance during busy season.</li>
